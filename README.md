## High-performance C++ open-world game engine core

**Roam Engine is a modern, high-performance **C++ game engine core** designed for large-scale open-world and sandbox-style games.** Inspired by next-generation streaming, physics simulation, and modular engine architecture, Roam Engine allows developers to create massive cities, dynamic environments, and immersive gameplay experiences from a unified development interface.

Roam Engine is built with scalability and realism in mind, offering tools for world streaming, advanced physics, AI systems, and cinematic rendering pipelines. The engine focuses on low-level systems such as rendering, physics, world streaming, memory management, and simulation layers rather than providing a built-in visual editor.

## Free, open-source, and developer-driven

Roam Engine is fully open source and distributed under the **MIT License**.

* No royalties
* No subscription fees
* Full access to engine source code

Developers own 100% of their creations. The engine is developed transparently with community contributions, allowing creators to influence new features, performance optimizations, and engine direction.

Roam Engine started as an experimental open-world engine project focused on GTA-style gameplay mechanics, large map streaming, and real-time simulation systems. Today, it continues to evolve into a flexible and powerful engine platform.

## Building Roam Engine

### Source-only distribution

Roam Engine is distributed as **C++ source code only**. There are no prebuilt editors or graphical tools. Developers integrate Roam Engine directly into their own game projects or custom toolchains.

### Building from source

Roam Engine can be compiled from source for maximum customization and performance.

Basic steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roamengine/roam-engine.git
cd roam-engine
cmake .
make
```

Detailed build instructions for Windows, Linux, and macOS can be found in the documentation.
